# IoT based Food Quality Monitoring System
This project aims to implement an IoT-based Smart Food Quality Monitoring System that actively monitors the quality of food transported from one location to another notifying both the Consumer and Seller about the food quality. It addresses a major issue of Food Spoilage. The different sensors continuously monitor the food and upload the resultant data to the cloud and a local web server via an IoT analytics platform ThingSpeak, allowing both the Consumer and Seller to check the food quality of the transported items. All components are packaged into a compact setup that can be placed inside delivery vehicles.
